# TC2R2
The Tropical Convection and Climate Research Repository is a 
place for the sharing of code for the CSU Tropical Cyclones, 
Radar, Atmospheric Modeling, and Software Team (TC-RAMS). 

The primary goal of this repository will be to facilitate the
sharing of julia and python scripts that are used to create 
figures for the research activity within TC-RAMS.  Because 
many of us are still learning julia and python we want to 
create a library of functions and scripts that have been 
written to analyse data.  

For examples of the figures that have been created using the scripts in TC2R2, see the TC2R2figures.pdf document.
